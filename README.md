# Fecom Inc. CRM analysis
### Project Overview & Business Value
Fecom Inc. is an e‑commerce marketplace with many one‑time buyers. The company wants to reduce churn and stop wasting marketing budget on low‑value customers. This project uses its CRM data to identify which countries and sellers bring customers who come back (second order) and generate the highest lifetime revenue, so Fecom can decide where to cut spending and where to invest more.
